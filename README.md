0. Introduction:
   The goal of the project is to show at least two steam trains running on a tracks.  At least two trains will be drawn in the scene with each running on its own track. The train will run through a tunnel inside a mountain. The scene will include a few mountains. 

1. What I have done so far:
	a. The train. Please take a close at the wheels and the breaks. Especially the brakes are attached to the wheels which keep moving around the wheel like a real train.  The wheel consists different parints including two rings of different size. The inner ring fits the track and keep the train running on the track, which is like a real wheel.  
	b. The mountians. Diamond squre algorithm is used to generate the mountains, and the smoothing algorithm is used to smooth the mountain.
	c. Lighting is also applied. by clicking 'd', you will be able to switch between moon and spotlights.
	d. it's raining.
	e. the engine emits smoke. Particle system is developed to simulate smoke. 
	f. arrow keys and page up/down is available to change the angle.
